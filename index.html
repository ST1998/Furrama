( 1 ) Being an international group, you have to speak in English. The other languages â€‹â€‹should be used in case of need. Although you can speak in English, it does not mean that you can use, regardless of dialects, incorrect English and SMS-style abbreviations, which is only annoying for the reader.<br><br>
( 2 ) While discussing various topics, it is advisable to treat the most sensitive and impresionable issues with a certain weight, in order not to risk causing discomfort, misunderstanding and quarrels among the participants (if the latter should happen, go in private and try to clarify  each other).<br><br>
( 3 ) Being an SFW group, no pornography, gore, vore, scat and the like. Allowed censorship of them.<br><br>
( 4 ) It is advisable not to go overboard with bad words, but to say them right when they are needed.  As for blasphemies, they are prohibited.<br><br>
( 5 ) Unless you want to keep it just for yourself, it is forbidden to record (copy, forward, screenshot, etc.) the group's conversations and bring them back to the outside.  And no spies.<br><br>
( 6 ) It is advisable to reply the message of a participant with the Reply command and not responding as a response detached from that message, both to understand some message you are replying and to send the notification of that participant if the latter has silenced the  notifications of every message that is sent to the group (the latter can be done by writing and sending the username of that participant).<br><br>
( 7 ) Respect everyone's freedoms and moral choices. Irony, parody and / or satire are allowed, which are not intrusive and / or heavy to create a strong embarrassment.<br><br>
( 8 ) Do not contact one in private if he/she does not want to (in fact, No PM Friendly), if it is not a "real" emergency or the staffer does it.<br><br>
( 9 ) If you want to add your own voip account to the group (no more than one), ask the staffer for permission.<br><br>
( 10 ) For security reasons, it is necessary to say something (e.g. a greeting) once you join the group.<br><br>
( 11 ) Spam only with staffer permission: No group, channel, site on porn, gore and disgrace.<br><br>
( 12 ) No abuse of posts, images, audio, stickers, links, etc.  per sec (e.g. 10 post / sec). It is not a race.<br><br>
( 13 ) Any problem, write and send in the group @Stegon98. Don't abuse it!</div><br><br><br>
